The repository is organized into the following directories:

* `agent/`: Contains the agent implemented in Go.
* `api/`: Houses the API service developed in Python.
* `web/`: Includes the frontend application built with NextJS.
* `.github/workflows/`: Contains GitHub Actions workflows for CI/CD.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bohdanbulakh/mtsd-lab4.git
   cd mtsd-lab4
   ```

2. **Set up each component:**
    * **API Service (Python):**

      ```bash
      cd backend
      python3 -m venv venv
      source venv/bin/activate
      pip install -r requirements.txt
      ```

    * **Agent Service (Go):**

      ```bash
      cd agent
      go build
      ```

    * **Web Frontend (TypeScript):**

      ```bash
      cd web
      corepack enable
      yarn install
      ```

## Configuration

Set environment variables up for each component:

* **Agent:**

    * API_URL

* **Web Frontend:**

    * [Development](./web/.env.development)
    * [Production](./web/.env.production)

## Usage

After setting up all components:

1. Run the API service.
    ```bash
   cd backend
   uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
   ```

2. Start the agent service on your devices.
    ```bash
   cd agent
   ./Agent
   ```

3. Launch the web frontend.
    ```bash
   cd web
   yarn dev
    ```

> [!TIP]
> You can also use a containerized version of *api* and *agent* by running `docker compose up` in corresponding
> directories.
